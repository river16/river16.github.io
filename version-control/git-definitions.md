# Git Definitions

THIS IS A MINOR CHANGE TO THIS NEWFEATURE BRANCH FILE

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
 Version control allows you to track progress, review and revert changes, and create backups in your code. GitHub is a version control tool. It is especially helpful on large projects and multiple programmers for tracking and debugging by being able to revert back to save points.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
You use a branch to preserve the master code, make changes in the branch instead, leaving the master code untouched. Branching give you a copy of the master to work on.


* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is saving code changes at a point in time that a programmer or reviewer can go back to or revert back to.

* What is a merge conflict?
This happens when two branches have changed the same part of the same file.  Git returns a message to resolve the conflict before a merge can take place.
